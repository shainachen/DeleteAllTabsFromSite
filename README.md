# CloseAllTabsFromSite

This simple Google Chrome extension allows the user to close all tabs from a website with a single click of a button.

## How It Works
The user navigates to an open tab of the website they would like to close all tabs from. For example, there are two [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) tabs open in this window.

Then, the user clicks on the extension and a popup appears. The user then clicks on the button "close all tabs from site" to close all open tabs with the same host name.
